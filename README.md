# Coursera Final Project

It is a jupyter notebook where I built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
Loaded the dataset, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on it. 

I used the following algorithms to build the models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression


The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoss (only on Logistic Regression model)
